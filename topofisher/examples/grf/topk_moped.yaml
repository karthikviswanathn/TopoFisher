# Compression configuration
compression:
  type: moped                # MOPED optimal compression
  trainable: false            # MOPED doesn't require training
  params:
    train_frac: 0.5           # Fraction for internal train/test split
    clean_data: true          # Remove zero-variance features
    reg: 1e-6                 # Regularization for covariance inversion

# No training section needed since no components are trainable
