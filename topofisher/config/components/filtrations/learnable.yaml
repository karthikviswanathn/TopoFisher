# Learnable filtration with CNN transformation
# Transforms N×N input fields using CNN before computing persistence
# Fully convolutional - works with any input size, preserves dimensions
type: learnable
trainable: true  # Must be true for learnable filtration
params:
  homology_dimensions: [0, 1]
  hidden_channels: [32, 64, 32]  # CNN architecture
  kernel_size: 3
  activation: relu
