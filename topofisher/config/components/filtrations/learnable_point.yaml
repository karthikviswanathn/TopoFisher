# Learnable Point Filtration for point clouds (Flag Complex)
# Uses MLP to learn vertex filtration from k-nearest neighbor distances
# Edge filtration: max(f(u), f(v)) + edge_length
type: learnable_point
trainable: true  # Must be true for learnable filtration
params:
  k: 10                      # Number of nearest neighbors
  hidden_dims: [20, 10]          # Hidden layer dimensions (list), [] for linear
  dropout: 0.0               # Dropout probability
  homology_dimensions: [0, 1]
  complex_type: alpha        # 'alpha' or 'rips'
  p: 1.0                     # Edge filtration: (d^p + fmax^p)^(1/p)
